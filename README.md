### Data Analysis
   We used Pivot tables to calculate the Sales Revenue with Region,Market,Store and UnitSold.
 Several Structured queries were written to get the right tables and then saved as views in the database on 
 SQL Management Studio.
 Using this Syntax
 ```SQL
 SELECT *(  
 FROM TABLE 1
 WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
 );
```
    These tables were imported into PowerBI desktop for analysis and also DAX expression were used
    during analyzing the Data.  Column quality, Column distributions, Empty columns and appropriate 
    Datatypes were checked when the Data was transformed into the Power Query.
